# comunio-stats-root
Contains all subprojects belonging to the comunio-stats project

## Start with docker-compose
If you want to build and run the mysql db, Spring Boot backend and the reactjs frontend you might want to use the ./docker-compose/build_start_docker.sh script. If you are a new developer, you should copy the script and set the VAR $ROOT to the root directory of this project directory.
